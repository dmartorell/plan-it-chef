# Plan It Chef

This is my final project at SkylabCoders Academy. 'Plan It Chef' is a fullstack web app addressed to foodies and cooking lovers that allows users to extract recipes from the internet, format and save them. It also features one-click shopping lists creation and mixed lists.

The work was commissioned by a very important client from the U.S. To be more precise, my wife, Candice, the best chef in the world and one of the most organized people I know. 'Plan it Chef' is for her :)

The project was completed in three weeks and I used React, Redux and Sass in the front-end and Nodejs, Expressjs, and MongoDB in the back-end. It also includes a Signup / Login strategy with Passport and It's been fully tested using Jest.
